# EZWorksheet Installer

As you see, ive decided to open-source the installer so people can use it in their apps and learn from it. Enjoy 

This installer uses `OpenFL` and `Lime`.

## Building

The installer itself can only install the windows version, but thats because i don't
use mac/linux, and havent compiled to them yet :P



```
lime build windows
cd .\Export\windows\bin\
.\EZWorksheet-Installer.exe
```

Dont worry, this will be fixed soons, and more compilation targets will be available
